self-intro:
I’m a full-stack engineer with expertise in distributed systems and a passion for AI-driven, data-powered solutions. I love exploring system design, business logic, and data flows to uncover new ways technology can optimize performance and efficiency at scale.


Education: B.S. Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley. Fall 2015 - Fall 2019

Experience:
Microsoft – Software Engineer (Mar 2022 – Feb 2025, Mountain View, CA)
At Microsoft, I helped shape the future of productivity by building APIs and infrastructure for Copilot and Teams. I worked on large-scale systems that needed to be both fast and reliable, raising critical API reliability to 99.97%. I led vendor teams to fully automate testing pipelines, which boosted code quality and developer velocity. On top of development, I carried global on-call responsibilities—solving high-priority incidents for Fortune 500 customers across eight regions. These experiences honed my ability to design for scale, resilience, and user trust.

Michaels – Software Engineer (Oct 2020 – Mar 2022, San Jose, CA)
I was part of Michaels’ transformation from a legacy e-commerce system to a modern, scalable platform. On the backend, I built authentication flows, in-app messaging, and secure user management with JWT and Spring Boot. On the frontend, I brought the new platform to life by creating interactive dashboards and management tools in React and Redux. This role gave me end-to-end ownership across the stack, from designing APIs to delivering user-facing features.

Qcompass Voyage Limited (Qeeq.com) – Software Engineer (Jan 2018 – Aug 2019, Hong Kong)
At this fast-growing car rental startup operating in 160+ countries, I wore multiple hats as both a full-stack engineer and data analyst. I built analytics dashboards used daily by 200+ employees across product, marketing, and finance teams, enabling smarter pricing and operational strategies. I also optimized large-scale data pipelines to handle millions of data points efficiently. This early experience taught me how to merge engineering with data insights to drive business growth.

project:

Custom Macros for Dynamics (2024)
I created a feature that lets customers write and run custom JavaScript inside Dynamics to automate repetitive workflows. This became a key enabler for migrating enterprise clients from outdated systems to a modern SaaS platform, making customization both powerful and manageable.

Agent Diagnostic Tool (2023)
I built a self-service diagnostic system inside Dynamics 365 that empowered support agents to troubleshoot their own environment issues. By running pre-defined diagnostic rules and generating detailed reports, agents could resolve problems faster and open fewer tickets. This tool directly improved support efficiency and customer satisfaction.

In-App Messaging for Marketplaces (2021)
To improve buyer-seller communication, I designed an in-app messaging service with text, image sharing, push notifications, and even broadcast messaging capabilities. By integrating with Twilio’s APIs, the system increased engagement and kept conversations flowing across devices.

Identity & Access Management (2020)
I developed a complete role-based access control (RBAC) system with APIs for managing users, roles, and permissions. The system included detailed activity logs, multithreaded processing for scale, and email notifications for security alerts—ensuring enterprises could manage identity securely and reliably.
